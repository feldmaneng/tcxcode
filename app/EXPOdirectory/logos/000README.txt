Please note that these logo files should be permanent since the WordPress EXPO directories will be archived.
Therefore, when a copy has an update logo please save it with a different file name. Ideally with the year in the
name.

Ideally files should have a transparent, not white background.
If necessary to edit a logo file (that is current), okay to overwrite existing file.

Nominally size is 150 x 150 pixels in WordPress EXPO directory.
